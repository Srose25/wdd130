        I'm a software engineering with hopes to do game development as a hobby. I've always loved telling
        and observing stories. I like to write, act, and goof off. I'm extremely single if anyone was wondering.
        I work at a pest control company called Alta and do customer service there.

        I'm pursuing a Bachelors degree at Byu-I and the thing I love most about it is the quality of education
        for the price that they are offering. It's an incredible blessing to be able to study these things and 
        have the ability to finance it myself. I'm required to take web development. It's not something I would've
        immediately taken. I know a little bit of HTML from highschool but that's about it. I'm ready to learn more.
        I'm hoping to learn good skills to market businesses and set up good websites in the future for those businesses.

        I've been a member of the Church my whole life. I returned from my mission last December and have been getting
        back into the swing of things. Some of my favorite teachings come from the current prophet, President Nelson. 
        My favorite being his more recent talk "Peacemakers Needed".

        I like to play Super Smash bros.
