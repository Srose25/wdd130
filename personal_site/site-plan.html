        This is my own personal website with all of my favorite projects and accomplishments.
         I'm a software engineering major in my 2nd/3rd year of college. I have big dreams to
          entertain people with stories and art through the vast digital realm!

        I grew up doing theater and music throughout school and during those same years
         I took a computer science class that taught me the basics of coding and design.
          It was at that moment I knew I could do something with this and decided I wanted
           to become a software engineer, game developer, and so on!

        On My mission I also found likeminded people who wanted to make games. Since then
         we've decided we want to work as a team to make these big dreams of ours come true.
          Over here is a picture of me and my friend Porter and Corben. 

        I fully intend to update this page further with more interactive examples
         as soon as I learn more Javascript. I don't want this to just be words on
          a screen. But to fully be an interactive experience (you know, game development and stuff).
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>TurboSquad</h3>
      <p>
        Now, you're probably thinking I'm just terrible at naming things
         but this time it's intentional. The Turbosquad is a group of highschool
          friends turned superhero group. They become friends while all in detention
           and then band together to use their gifts for good in this gripping and
            heartwarming adventure. As they topple crime lords, grapple with good
             and evil within themselves, and sacrifice for the greater good we learn
              that friendship means a lot more than being buddies.

        Gameplay wise this is my attempt at making a fighting game. Fighting games
         are incredibly complex and very fun to me. I regularly play smash bros and
          I wanted to create something with the same imagination as that game but on
           a smaller scale. The gimmick I want to introduce is something called “Turbo Mode”
            which sounds like a regular special attack, but really changes the entire way your
             character works. Each character has two different movesets: “Platforming" and
              Street fighting”. This mechanic allows you to switch up your moveset depending
               on different circumstances. If you are in an advantageous state you'll want to
                switch to street mode allowing for better combo chains, if you're in disadvantage
                 you'll want to switch to platform mode so you can run and jump away from your
                  opponent.

        This is a project I know will take a lot of time and precision but that's why my goals
         aren't to rush out any projects but to really take the time, put in the effort, and make
          something quality. I hope a game like this can encourage people to reinvent big fighting
           games.

      <h3>Destine</h3>
      <p>
        This one is my personal pride and joy. A project I've been working
         on for years. Since my Junior year of highschool in fact. The original
          story idea was something very similar to Ender's Game which is one of my
           favorite sci fi books. There's a reason I took so much inspiration from
            it at first. However, now that it's almost been 6 years since then this
             entire world is unrecognizable from its origins. 

        For a really quick synopsis. You play as a lone traveler in a vast galaxy with
         no memory or experience in it. A complete blank slate. You're sent on a mission
          by the Galactic Government because of things that happened before you were created.
           You're a clone of a race of aliens that was thought to be wiped out and the alien
            that created the cloning pod thought to be dead. The government wants him dead but
             they mask it as a grand quest for you to embark on. So as you venture the galaxy
              you learn all about this history, meet people and make friends. 

        The story is meant to handle themes of self, responsibility and morality, and unification.
         I'm proud to say that it's a much bigger story than just following the character you play
          as. What truly will make this story more interesting is following the stories of those all
           across the galaxies and their hopes and dreams. While I'm still fleshing out all of these
            I have 30 worlds I want the player to explore each with their own stories and people to
             meet.

             Of all of the projects I've talked about this is one that I'm not only the most
              excited to finish, but excited to work on in general. It truly is the reason I
               want to become a software engineer and pursue this field and knowledge.
