            Now, you're probably thinking I'm just terrible at naming 
            things but this time it's intentional. The Turbosquad is a 
            group of highschool friends turned superhero group. They become 
            friends while all in detention and then band together to use their 
            gifts for good in this gripping and heartwarming adventure. As they 
            topple crime lords, grapple with good and evil within themselves, and 
            sacrifice for the greater good we learn that friendship means a lot more 
            than being buddies.

                Gameplay wise this is my attempt at making a fighting game. Fighting 
                games are incredibly complex and very fun to me. I regularly play smash 
                bros and I wanted to create something with the same imagination as that 
                game but on a smaller scale. The gimmick I want to introduce is something 
                called “Turbo Mode” which sounds like a regular special attack, but really 
                changes the entire way your character works. Each character has two different 
                movesets: “Platforming" and Street fighting”. This mechanic allows you to switch 
                up your moveset depending on different circumstances. If you are in an advantageous 
                state you'll want to switch to street mode allowing for better combo chains, if 
                you're in disadvantage you'll want to switch to platform mode so you can run and 
                jump away from your opponent.

                This is a project I know will take a lot of time and precision but that's why 
                my goals aren't to rush out any projects but to really take the time, put in the 
                effort, and make something quality. I hope a game like this can encourage people 
                to reinvent big fighting games.
