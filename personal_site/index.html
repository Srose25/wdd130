                This is my own personal website with all of my 
                favorite projects and accomplishments. I'm a software 
                engineering major in my 2nd/3rd year of college. I have big 
                dreams to entertain people with stories and art through the 
                vast digital realm!
            </p>

            <p>
                I grew up doing theater and music throughout school and during 
                those same years I took a computer science class that taught me 
                the basics of coding and design. It was at that moment I knew I could 
                do something with this and decided I wanted to become a software engineer, 
                game developer, and so on!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="h-text2">
            <p>
                On the first page I've wrote down the concept and ideas for a game me and my 
                buddies decided to make while we were all missionaries. The idea was to rewrite 
                a super hero show but then we made such drastic changes that it suddenly took on 
                its own identity. The second page is for a project that I myself have worked on 
                since I was in highschool and is my personal pride and joy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Later on, I fully intend to update this page further with more interactive examples as 
                soon as I learn more Javascript. I don't want this to just be words on a screen. 
                But to be a fully interactive experience (you know, game development and stuff).
