                This is my own personal website with all of my 
                favorite projects and accomplishments. I'm a software 
                engineering major in my 2nd/3rd year of college. I have big 
                dreams to entertain people with stories and art through the 
                vast digital realm!
            </p>

            <p>
                I grew up doing theater and music throughout school and during 
                those same years I took a computer science class that taught me 
                the basics of coding and design. It was at that moment I knew I could 
                do something with this and decided I wanted to become a software engineer, 
                game developer, and so on!
            </p>

        <div class="h-text2">
            <p>
                On Page 1 is a list of the game ideas I have lined up for making with me 
                and some of my friends. Some I've worked on for years, and others are a bit 
                newer. On Page two I have some more interactive things I worked on. Including 
                the music I've wrote for some of these projects and (potentially a minesweeper 
                game if I can manage it)
            </p>

            <p>
                I fully intend to update this page further with more interactive examples as 
                soon as I learn more Javascript. I don't want this to just be words on a screen. 
                But to fully be an interactive experience (you know, game development and stuff).
